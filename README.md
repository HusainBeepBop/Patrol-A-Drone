## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q1: Why was a heavy-lift carbon fiber frame chosen?**
A: To support large propellers and heavy payloads, while ensuring vibration damping and portability.

**Q2: What makes the propulsion system efficient?**
A: Large, slow-spinning carbon fiber propellers paired with high-torque motors and reliable ESCs maximize thrust and endurance.

**Q3: Why use Li-Ion batteries over LiPo?**
A: Li-Ion offers higher energy density, enabling longer flight times critical for inspection missions.

**Q4: What is the role of the payload?**
A: The integrated sensor suite (EO/IR camera, LiDAR) enables detailed inspection and 3D mapping from a safe distance.

**Q5: How is precise navigation achieved?**
A: RTK GPS and robust flight control firmware ensure accurate geotagging and stable autonomous flight.

**Q6: How does the drone mitigate EMI near power lines?**
A: Smart placement of sensors, physical shielding, advanced software filtering, and operational standoff strategies.

**Q7: What drives the cost of the prototype?**
A: The payload (DJI H20T and Velodyne Puck) accounts for over 50% of the total cost due to its advanced capabilities.
